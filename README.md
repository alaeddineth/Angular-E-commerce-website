# First Angular Application

This is my first Angular application, showcasing my journey as an experienced Laravel developer exploring the integration of Angular with Laravel in a single application.

## Overview

Angular is a powerful front-end framework, and Laravel is a robust back-end framework. Combining the two allows for the creation of modern, dynamic web applications. With my experience in Laravel, I am excited to explore the possibilities of building feature-rich, efficient, and responsive web applications by integrating Angular on the front-end.
